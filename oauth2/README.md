# Single Sign On with OAuth2: Single Page Application with Spring and Angular JS

In this article we continue [our discussion][fourth] of how to use [Spring Security](http://projects.spring.io/spring-security) with [Angular JS](http://angularjs.org) in a "single page application". Here we show how to use [Spring Security OAuth](http://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth/) together with [Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/) to extend our API Gateway to do Single Sign On and OAuth2 token authentication to backend resources. This is the fifth in a series of articles, and you can catch up on the basic building blocks of the application or build it from scratch by reading the [first article][first], or you can just go straight to the [source code in Github](https://github.com/dsyer/spring-security-angular/tree/master/oauth2). In the [last article][fourth] we built a small distributed application that used [Spring Session](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/) to authenticate the backend resources and [Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/) to implement an embedded API Gateway in the UI server. In this article we extract the authentication responsibilities to a separate server to make our UI server the first of potentially many Single Sign On applications to the authorization server. This is a common pattern in many applications these days, both in the enterprise and in social media. We will use an OAuth2 server as the authenticator, so that we can also use it to mint a token for the backend resource server access. Spring Cloud will automatically relay the access token to our backend, and enable us to further simplify the implementation of both the UI and resource servers.

> Reminder: if you are working through this article with the sample application, be sure to clear your browser cache of cookies and HTTP Basic credentials. In Chrome the best way to do that for a single server is to open a new incognito window.
