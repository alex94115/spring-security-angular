# Bootstrap UI and JWT Tokens for the Authorization Server

You will find a version of this application in the [source code in Github](https://github.com/dsyer/spring-security-angular/tree/master/oauth2-vanilla) which has a whitelabel HTML interface and HTTP Basic authentication. This one has a pretty login page and user approval page implemented similarly to the way we did the login page in [the single server sample](https://github.com/dsyer/spring-security-angular/tree/master/single). It also uses [JWT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JWT) to encode the tokens, so instead of using the "/user" endpoint, the resource server can pull enough information out of the token itself to do a simple authentication.

> Warning: Startup order. You will find that if you don't get the authserver running first, the other components will not be able to get the verifier key for the JWT tokens (they will print a warning on startup). If you authenticate and approve the token grant successfully, and get 401s from the backend resources (so the home page is blank or missing its greeting), then restart the UI and resource servers.
